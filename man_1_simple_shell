.SH NAME

HSH \- simple_shell project

hsh : command line interpreter for the simple_shell project


.SH SYNOPSIS

- run "./hsh" (interactive mode)

- run "echo"/bin/(command)" | ./hsh" (non-interactive mode)


.SH DESCRIPTION

hsh is a part of the simple_shell project, a simple and limited recreation of the Unix shell program.

hsh permits to run simple_shell in both interactive and non-interactive mode.

It reads and implements basic commands input by the user.


.SH COMPILATION

hsh is compiled on UBUNTU 20.04.4 LTS with GCC 9.4.0., and flags -Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic.

The propmt 'Simple Shell Project$ ' will appear on terminal. Now you can enter commands after the prompt and then execute the commands by pressing 'ENTER' key.


.SH USAGE

Upon input of a command, the simple_shell follows these actions:

.SH - tokenizing the string that represents the entered command, followed by creating an array of pointers.

.SH - checking whether the command is an alias or a built-in command on the PATH variable by merging the command pointer with each directory pointer in the PATH variable.

.SH - If the pointers match, executing the command by forking the program, creating a child process with a different PID from the parent process.

.SH - After executing the command, the shell program stops the search, releases the memory, and prompts for the user's next input

.SH - quitting the program by entering 'exit' or do Ctrl + D.


.SH COMMANDS

$ ls / ls -l
$ /bin/ls -l
$ pwd
$ echo
$ env
$ exit
